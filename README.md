How do I approach designing software? 

When I'm designing software, I typically begin by analyzing the project's requirements as thoroughly as I can so that I have a good high-level overview of what it is exactly that I'm creating. Once that's done, I then begin tasking out all of the project's components into category buckets for work distribution later. Once that's done, I then start actually developing the items at hand. Unfortunally, sometimes I run into errors that hinder this process.

How do I approach developing programs? 

When it comes to actually creating the software, I try to create a functional minimum-viable product to show to my client to show that the concept works and to initate the feedback look for making the program as user-tailored as possible. The rest of the development time is simply more of these dev/feedback cycles.
